1. For the requirements I made sure that input data could sort atleast 20 entries in the MusicSpace class where it adds one song to the csv file and is a space to hold the data. It searches for the song with a stringstream making sure its grabs the correct data with title, artist, album, and year. I also made a function for users to be able to manage their menu being able to delete and show library of songs.
2. Some changes I made were to expand on each part of what I wanted in the project. For example creating a song needs the prompt the user with the menu, I used a switch case as depending on which option the user selects it shows the cout statement, a function to save user data specifically to the csv, and a if else statement if the file can't be saved.
